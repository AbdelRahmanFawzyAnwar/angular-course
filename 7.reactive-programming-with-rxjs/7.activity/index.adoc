There are two more very useful RxJS operators we could use in our sample Angular RxJS application.

`distinctUntilChanged` - http://reactivex.io/rxjs/class/es6/Observable.js~Observable.html#instance-method-distinctUntilChanged

`debounceTime` - http://reactivex.io/rxjs/class/es6/Observable.js~Observable.html#instance-method-debounceTime

Research both of these operators and extend the application so use them.

== Steps

Fork this plunker:

include::{section}/@activity/.link[]

Implement both the operators.

Read any *TODO* comments in the plunker for hints.

== Solution


When you are ready compare your answer to the solution in this plunker:
